Need to have a funnel
TOF - make the first connection
MOF - educate and lead
BOF- Sale

Don't try to close the sale on cold campaigns

Also when optimizing e.g. for TOF can try something other than PageViews
Try an event that  fb allows optimizing and demonstrates intent for
    -fire this event once user has taken an action on the page that signals intent
    e.g. click button etc...
    as can't optimize for custom events
    Check if possible to optimize for custom events and if yes tehn do this
    but may still be better to use an fb event if exists as fb better at optimizing for this
    (has more data)

Plan funnel here:
(start off with basic below)

1. Cold

-Goal is to educate them and get them to sign up

2. Warm/hot

-People who have signed up

-Goal is to convert them to pauing customers

3. 

-People who subscribed

-Goal is to purchase upsells
    -get reviews
    -refer
    -renew
