        <h2>Benefits of using quizElements QR codes for surveys</h2>
        <b>Ease of taking surveys:</b> Taking feedback through a QR code survey is as easy as it can get. All that the participants require doing is scanning the QR code through their cameras and start taking the survey.
        <b><br>Convenience for brands:</b> QR codes can be printed on any physical medium such as receipts, flyers, posters, product packaging, etc. This allows brands to reach their customers at various touchpoints and collect feedback on the spot.
        <b><br>Faster data collection:</b> QR codes can help brands collect data in real-time and avoid delays or drop-offs that may occur with other methods such as emails or phone calls.
        <b><br>Contactless feedback:</b> QR codes can provide a safe and hygienic way of collecting feedback, especially during the pandemic. Customers can scan the QR code without touching anything and fill the survey on their own devices.
        <b><br>Better survey participation:</b> QR codes can increase the response rates and quality of feedback by making it easy and convenient for customers to share their opinions and experiences. QR codes can also attract attention and curiosity, which can motivate customers to scan them and take the survey.
        <b><br>Instant feedback sharing:</b> QR codes can enable brands to share feedback instantly with their customers, such as thank you messages, coupons, rewards, etc. This can help improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
        <b><br>Unidentified source feedback:</b> QR codes can allow brands to collect anonymous feedback from customers who may not want to share their personal details or contact information. This can help brands get honest and unbiased feedback from their customers.
